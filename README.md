### What?
This project was created together with the "Semana OmniStack 11.0" of <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br"> Rocketseat </a> taught by Diego Fernandes. The project aim to create the first portfolio, introducing and teaching tecnologies like Node.js, ReactJS and React Native, as well as other libraries and resources.

### Why?
What motivated me to participate and create my own version of the project was to build a portfolio and get new knowledges. I will be very happy if you can send any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything else that you have noticed that can make me a better developer!

### The big idea
_"Find an NGO (Non-governmental organization) and save the day from wherever you're at!"._

### Project State
As a short project, I believe that I have reached a level of development sufficient to reap my learnings with Node.js, and mainly the frontend with ReactJS and React-Native wich is my focus right now.
